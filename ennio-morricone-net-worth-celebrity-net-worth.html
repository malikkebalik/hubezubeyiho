A Rome-based avant-garde ensemble, the group performed and recorded improvisatory compositions using experimental music methods. The group released seven albums in total.</p><h2 id=film-scores-in-1960s-70s><strong>Film Scores in the 1960s and 70s</strong></h2><p>Morricone started his career as a film score composer ghostwriting for other composers.
