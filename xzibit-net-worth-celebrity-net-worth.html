id=what-xzibit8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Xzibit's Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Xzibit is an American rapper, actor and television host who has a net worth of $500 thousand. Xzibit first gained fame as a musician on the West Coast hip-hop scene and later as a television host of MTV's "Pimp My Ride." If you're thinking Xzibit's net worth should be higher, keep in mind that the rapper has had some financial problems over the years. He has filed for bankruptcy twice, once in 2009 and again in 2010. At one point he owed the IRS nearly $1 million in back taxes. He has since recovered somewhat, but more details about Xzibit's financial situation in a moment.</p><h2 id=financial-tax-problems><strong>Financial and Tax Problems</strong></h2><p>In 2010 it was revealed that Xzibit owed $900,000 in delinquent federal taxes. Xzibit filed for bankruptcy for the first time in July 2009 and a second time in January 2010. Both cases were dismissed. According to his 2010 filing, at that time the rapper had $793,433 worth of assets but $1.4 million worth of debts. In the filing Xzibit pinned his financial problems on the 2007 cancellation of "Pimp My Ride." When the show was on, he was making just under $500,000 from MTV. In the year immediately after the show was canceled, he made just $67,510. The filing further showed that at the time the show was airing Xzibit was actually not a car owner. He was renting a 2006 Range Rover at a cost of $2,230 per month.</p><p>In July 2022, Xzibit filed a response to his ex-wife Krista's request for spousal support that stated he was no longer the primary breadwinner after losing the majority of his income due to COVID canceling live shows. According to his claim, Xzibit has not worked in a major capacity since 2019. Meanwhile he claims Krista makes $175,000 per year in salary while living in their former marital home. He further claims that at one point they agreed to sell the mansion, which he believed could be worth as much as $3 million in the hot 2021 housing market, but Krista was slow to act and actually allowed a new boyfriend to move in with his children. By the time he filed the claim in mid-2022, Krista had agreed to move out of the house but Xzibit was worried the cooled-down market would prevent them from getting the best price.</p><p>In his filing, the rapper claimed to be</p><p>"â€¦<strong>struggling to make end meet at the same time trying to uphold being a public figure, pay my own expenses and provide for me son.</strong>"</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Xzibit was born Alvin Nathaniel Joiner on September 18, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan. At the age of ten, he began to rap to help him cope with the loss of his mother. At the age of 14, he got into trouble and was removed from his home when his father refused to allow him to continue living there. Xzibit was released from the state on his own recognizance as an adult at 17. He pulled some money together and jumped into his jeep and headed toward Los Angeles, California. He cites his mother, who was a writer, as his source of creativity.</p><h2 id=rap-career><strong>Rap Career</strong></h2><p>Xzibit started rapping at age 14 under the pseudonym "Exhibit A." His first professional appearance on a record was in February 1995 on the Alkaholiks' "Coast II Coast" on the song "Hit and Run." He signed to Loud records the same year and released his acclaimed debut album "At the Speed of Life" in October 1996. The record went to No. 74 on the Billboard Hot 200 and reached 38 on the Canadian Albums Chart. His breakthrough single "Paparazzi" was very successful in Germany.</p><p>While he started growing a large following on the West Coast, he released his second album "40 Dayz & 40 Nightz" in 1998. It was well-received by critics and is considered a Classic West Coast hip-hop record. It spawned four successful singles including "What U See is What U Get." Xzibit eventually caught the eye of <a href=# title="Dr Dre Net Worth">Dr. Dre</a>, who helped secure him several high profile guest spots. He made his acting debut in 1999 when he starred in "The Breaks."</p><p>Xzibit's real breakthrough occurred with the release of his third studio album "Restless," with Dr. Dre serving as executive producer and with guest appearances by <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# title="Eminem Net Worth">Eminem</a>, and other super famous names. It sold almost 2 million copies and was certified platinum, as well as spawned three singles. Xzibit continued to star in films including "The Wash," "The Slim Shady Show," and "8 Mile." In 2002, he guest-starred on the comedy series "<a href=# title="Cedric the Entertainer Net Worth">Cedric the Entertainer</a> Presents" and released his fourth studio album "Man vs. Machine," which spawned three singles that unfortunately failed to chart although the album itself went gold.</p><p>During his career, Xzibit has worked with numerous high-profile artists such as Eminem, Cypress Hill, Snoop Dogg, <a href=# title="Ice Cube Net Worth">Ice Cube</a>, Dr. Dre, Knoc-turn'al, <a href=# title="Timbaland Net Worth">Timbaland</a>, Limp Bizkit, <a href=# title="Alice Cooper Net Worth">Alice Cooper</a>, Game, <a href=# title="50 Cent Net Worth">50 Cent</a> and Within Temptation. On the international stage, he has worked with such overseas acts as Russian rapper Timati, Raptile from Germany, Bliss N Eso from Australia and Adil Omar from Pakistan. Xzibit's rhymes resonate with his audience because he speaks from the heart as an individual, rather than a hip-hop persona.</p><p>After a four year hiatus from music, he teamed up with Extreme Music and released a new compilation of material titled "Urban Ammo 2" in March 2011. In 2012, Xzibit released his next album, entitled "Napalm."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314790 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Xzibit-1.jpg alt width=900 height=830 sizes="(max-width: 1597px) 100vw, 1597px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314790 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Timothy Hiatt/Getty Images for WE)</p><h2 id=pimp-my-ride><strong>Pimp My Ride</strong></h2><p>Between 2004 and 2007 Xzibit hosted the MTV show "Pimp My Ride". The show brought him international mainstream fame. Ironically, the show actually cost Xzibit money as he was unable to tour when the show was in production and his salary per episode was not significant. On the other hand, the show made Xzibit a household name who is still relevant to this day. After the cancelation of the show, he starred in more movies and had guest spots on crime TV series.</p><h2 id=pimp-my-ride-salary><strong>Pimp My Ride Salary</strong></h2><p>At the peak of "Pimp My Ride" Xzibit earned $497,175 per year in salary from MTV.</p><h2 id=other-work><strong>Other Work</strong></h2><p>It was announced in February 2016 that he would be joining the cast of "Empire" as the character of Shyne. He appeared in 38 episodes of the show over 2016 to 2019. Xzibit has announced his eighth studio album will be titled "King Makers" and is slated to be released in 2021. Over the course of his career, Xzibit has also voiced himself in several video games.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Xzibit married his longtime girlfriend Krista Joiner on November 29, 2014 in Laguna Beach, California at the St. Regis Monarch Beach. Unfortunately the wedding had a slightly awkward ending. In the very early morning hours on the night of the wedding (technically Sunday morning) Xzibit was pulled over by police in Laguna Beach for speeding. After a failed sobriety test, police arrested the rapper and booked him on DUI charges. Krista filed for divorce from X in February 2021.</p><p>Xzibit and Krista had two children together, Xavier and Gatlyn. Tragically, Xavier was born prematurely on May 15, 2008, and died just eleven days later. Xzibit has another son from a previous relationship, Tremaine Joiner (born in June 1995.)</p><h2 id=gumball-3000><strong>Gumball 3000</strong></h2><p>Xzibit participated in the Gumball 3000 rally in 2007. He drove a black Jaguar XJ220. During the first day of the rally, Dutch police seized his driver's license for driving over 160 km/hour in a 100 km/hour zone. His co-driver Fredwreck Nassar took over the wheel after his penalty and they were allowed to continue. In an interview later with Dutch radio personality Reinout "Q Bah" van Gendt, Xzibit claimed that he mistook the kilometers for miles. He never got his license back from Dutch police and had to apply for a new one once back in the United States. He competed again in the 2013 and 2014 Gumball 3000s.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2003 Xzibit paid $670,000 for a 3,160 square-foot home in the LA suburb of Woodland Hills. In 2008 he attempted to sell the home for $1.2 million. By 2010 he lowered the price to $650,000. He appears to have accepted $610,000 for the home in December 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX63Hqq7IrWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alex-curran-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alex Curran Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</a>
