of $125 million. Drew Barrymore came through the fire and came out on top. The child of famous thespians, she grew up around show business, and was already a bonafide star by the time she was seven.&nbsp; Her high-profile early roles in films like E.T. The Extra-terrestrial, Firestarter, and Irreconcilable Differences, made her a media darling, and ended her childhood quickly.&nbsp; She was often in the company of people who were much older than she was, and her parents were anything but stable influences.&nbsp; She began smoking and drinking while still in elementary school, and had graduated to cocaine by the time she was in eighth grade.&nbsp; Two stints in rehab, a suicide attempt, and a successful request for emancipation from her parents, defined her teen years, and it was not until she was in her early 20s that she began to settle down.&nbsp; Since then, she has starred in a string of hit movies, many of which she has produced with her own production company, Flower Films.&nbsp; These projects include, The Wedding Singer, Riding in Cars with Boys, Never Been Kissed, Charlie's Angels and its sequel, 50 First Dates, Fever Pitch, and He's Just Not That Into You.</p><p>Drew continues to work on both the big and small screen as well as in a variety of other fields, including her cosmetics line, clothing brand, and even her own signature wine. At the height of her career as a movie star, Barrymore earned $15 million a picture.</p><p>In 2023, Drew Barrymore was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Born on February 22nd, 1975, Drew Barrymore had movie stardom in her blood from the very beginning, as a member of one of the most famous acting families in show business history. Her paternal grandfather, the legendary John Barrymore, was among the most acclaimed actors of his day, and the list of Barrymores both before and after him that have worked as actors is too long to include here. Drew she also counts such famous film figures as <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a> and <a href=# title="Sophia Loren Net Worth">Sophia Loren</a> among her godparents. Her famously troubled childhood included parties, drugs, and alcohol at an extremely early age, going into rehab at 13 and emancipating from her parents at age 15.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262322 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Drew-Barrymore.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262322 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=acting-career><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Barrymore's acting career began even earlier in her life, at just 11 months old. As the story goes, she was nipped by a dog during her audition for a dog food commercial and responded by laughing rather than crying, which purportedly earned her the job. A few years later she made her feature film debut in the 1980 science fiction film Altered States, but it was her role as Elliot's younger sister Gertie in E.T. two years later that propelled her to worldwide film stardom.</p><p>After E.T., Barrymore was cast in the 1984 <a href=# title="Stephen King Net Worth">Stephen King</a> adaptation Firestarter. That same year, in a role with eerie parallels to her actual life, she played a young girl in a legal battle to divorce her famous parents in Irreconcilable Differences. The following year, 1985, she starred in another King film, the horror anthology Cat's Eye. She&nbsp;continued to work throughout the 80s despite an increasingly troubled personal life.</p><p>The 1990s meant a change in image for Barrymore, as she worked hard to shed her child actor persona and began taking more mature teenage roles. The most iconic of these is probably 1992's Poison Ivy, which was a box office disappointment in its theatrical release but went on to become a cult favorite on home video. In 1993 she starred in another film that was destined for cult status: the truly undefinable erotic thriller Doppelganger. The late 90s brought another memorable performance in 1998's The Wedding Singer, alongside <a href=# title="Adam Sandler Net Worth">Adam Sandler</a>, and she capped off the decade in 1999 with Never Been Kissed.</p><p>In the 2000s, Drew Barrymore continued her rise to movie stardom with her part as one of the three Charlie's Angels in the 2000 reboot and its 2003 sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, for which she earned one of her biggest paydays at $14 million. But she also appeared in smaller independent films at the same time, like Donnie Darko and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Then in 2009 she made her feature directorial debut with the roller derby drama Whip It.</p><p>After a few more starring roles in films like Going the Distance and Blended, Barrymore underwent another career transition with a starring role in the Netflix original series Santa Clarita Diet alongside <a href=# title="Timothy Olyphant Net Worth">Timothy Olyphant</a>. In March 2021, she revealed she was taking an indefinite hiatus from acting, and she wrote a cookbook with chef Pilar Valdes called Rebel Homemaker which became a New York Times bestseller.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-325808 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Drew-Barrymore.jpg alt="Drew Barrymore Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1672px) 100vw, 1672px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-325808 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=producing-career><strong>Producing Career</strong></h2><p>In 1995, Drew co-founded the production company Flower Films with <a href=# title="Nancy Juvonen Net Worth">Nancy Juvonen</a>. Flower Films produced many of Drew's movies between 1999 and 2019 including, Never Been Kissed, Donnie Darko, 50 First Dates and Fever Pitch, among others. Flower Films also owns the film rights to Charlies Angels, so not only did Drew's company produce the first two installments of the films (in 2000 and 2003), but also the 2019 re-boot.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>The ups and downs of Drew Barrymore's personal life have been well documented and began when she was still a child, but her first marriage lasted for just two months in 1994 when she was 19 â€“ to a Los Angeles bar owner named Jeremy Thomas. In 1999 she met comedian <a href=#>Tom Green</a> and married him the following year. They made cameo appearances in each other's films, he in Charlie's Angels and she in his directorial debut Freddy Got Fingered â€“ but they were divorced in 2002. In 2012 she married art consultant <a href=#>Will Kopelman</a>, with whom she has two daughters â€“ they divorced in 2016.</p><p>She's also managed to be the namesake of not just one but two popular songs, one by <a href=#>SZA</a> and the other by rapper Bryce Vine.</p><p>Drew Barrymore is the godmother of <a href=# title="Frances Bean Cobain Net Worth">Frances Bean Cobain</a>, the daughter of <a href=# title="Kurt Cobain Net Worth">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a href=# title="Courtney Love Net Worth">Courtney Love</a>.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore-salary-highlights><strong>Drew Barrymore Salary Highlights</strong></h2><p>At various points in her career, Barrymore has had a penchant for doing smaller roles in films that she worked on for artistic satisfaction, with a smaller payday to match. For example, her reported $500,000 payday for Donnie Darko, or the $250,000 she took for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. In 1995 she got $1.5 million for her role in Mad Love, then in 1998 she commanded a $3 million salary for Ever After. In 2000 her debut in the Charlie's Angels franchise was worth $9 million, eventually getting $14 million for the sequel. Then in 2007, she earned her highest payday at $15 million.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Drew Barrymore has made headlines for her various real estate deals over the years. In 2019 she reportedly paid a little over $5.5 million for a 5,600-square-foot home near the beach in the Hamptons.</p><p>In 2010 Drew paid $5.5 million for a 6,258 square foot mansion in Montecito, California. The six bedroom, seven and a half bathroom home is nestled on just over two acres of land. The property also features stunning floor-to-ceiling windows, hardwood floors, a large, sunny, eat-in kitchen, and multiple fireplaces. There is also a long wrap-around porch attached to the house, along with a guesthouse with two floors, a laundry room, a terrace, fruit trees all around the property, and a garage that can hold up to four cars. She listed this home in 2013 for $7.5 million and sold it that year for $6.35 million.</p><p>In the summer of 2018 she sold a home in the Hollywood Hills for some $16.5 million.</p><p>Drew Barrymore currently lives in Manhattan where she hosts The Drew Barrymore Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLGzsdZmmZqqoq66sL7EZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./new-amsterdam-recap-03-10-20-season-2-episode-16-perspectives.html>&#171;&nbsp;New Amsterdam Recap 03/10/20: Season 2 Episode 16 Perspectives</a>
