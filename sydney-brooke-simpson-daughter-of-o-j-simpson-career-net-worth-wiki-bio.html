Most people believe that the artist is a self-taught photographer who has done so great in the field.</p><p>The lady is an excellent example of the fact that it is essential to have dedication and to work for something rather than just hoping it will happen out.</p><p>Mikula has a sister who is also a medical photographer in Boston. The skill and the will of photography run through the Mikula family, and it has remained with both the sisters for a long time.</p><p>The lack of information on the parents’ name suggests that there were some hardships in the childhood days. But one thing is sure Susan was interested in art from a young age. To add icing to the cake, her parents allowed the passion to flow as well.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Mikula is one of the well-known photographers who has made a name for herself with impressive artistic works. Most people may not know, but the artist has been in the stint of the art jury as well.</p><p>Besides being on the jury, Susan tried her hand in accounting to make a living.

The landscape photography collection has been on the show in both solo and group exhibitions in New York, Miami, San Francisco, and LA.</p><p>In 2007, the photographer exhibited the large scale digital Duraflex prints at new york statehouse, and the year was a big year resulting in the first show in New York.</p><p>In 2009, the artist had an exhibition at TJ Walton Gallery in Provincetown, attended by <strong>Rachael Maddow</strong> and<strong> Suzanne</strong> <strong>Westenhoefer</strong>.

The two lovebirds, however, are not in marriage and feel marriage is always not that important. The feeling of love is essential rather than tying it with the wedding.</p><p>The love story’s start was when Rachel was hiring to complete some yard work at her property in Berkshires. The couple lives happily in a Pre-civil farmhouse in western Massachusetts and owns a west village apartment in New York.</p><p>Rachel Maddow is, however, an American television host and a liberal political commentator. Maddow hosts the Rachel Maddow show, a nightly television show on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MSNBC</a>. Along with to go with it, she serves as a cable network’s special event with co-anchor Brian Williams.</p><p>Readers here might be glued to know about any other relationship quo of Susan.

The exact substantial net worth Susan is not known. The estimations of her net worth are to be around<strong> $5 million.</strong></p><h4 class="single-entry-title entry-title"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy Kulp Death, Net Worth, Bio, Husband, Career >></a></h4><p>In contrast, though, the net worth of her girlfriend Rachel is higher in comparison. The annual salary of the host is<strong> $7million</strong> and has a towering net worth of<strong> $20 million.</strong></p><p>Susan has made all of her net worth from the artistic works. Most of the time, she is seen with her partners attending an event and enjoy the glorified time. Sadly nothing on the annual income and assets owned of Mikula is available for anyone. Whatever might be the case, Susan is living a lavish life with her loved ones.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p>Susan Mikula might have come to the media more for her relationship than her skills; the woman’s fans are pretty limited.
