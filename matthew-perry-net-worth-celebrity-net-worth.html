Tragically, Matthew Perry died on October 28, 2023 at the age of 54.</p><p>Matthew Perry was best-known for playing the role of Chandler Bing on the sitcom "Friends". He appeared in all 236 of the show's episodes between 1994 and 2004. He also appeared in a number of additional shows and films, notably TV shows "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip", "Go On" and films like "Fools Rush In" and "The Whole Nine Yards".</p><p>Matthew Perry actually had a fairly stable career prior to "Friends". He gained notice for his theater work during high school, and after relocating to Los Angeles, he appeared in a steady string of guest starring roles on such shows as "Charles in Charge", "Silver Spoons", "Just the Ten of Us", "Highway to Heaven", "Growing Pains", "Empty Nest", "Who's the Boss?", "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Sibs", to name just a few programs.&nbsp; He also appeared in such films and television movies as "A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon", "Dance 'til Dawn", "She's Out of Control", "Call Me Anna", and "Deadly Relations".</p><p>In addition to his supporting and guest starring work, he also starred in multiple short-lived sitcoms, including "Second Chance", "Sydney", and "Home Free". He was a working actor in Hollywood, which is not something that every actor can say. He was so busy, in fact, that when he heard about the audition for a show called, "Six of One", which was later renamed, "Friends", he was actually unavailable because he was committed to filming a show called "LAX 2194."&nbsp; However, he did eventually become available and the rest is television history.</p><p>"Friends" went on to become one of the most successful television shows of all time, and the six cast members became extremely famous… and extremely wealthy. As we detail later in this article, at the peak of the series, each of the main cast members was earning $1 million per episode. In total Matthew earned around $90 million just from "Friends" base salary, before royalties from syndication, which have been quite substantial, reportedly as much as $10-20 million per year even to this day.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-250224 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Matthew-Perry.jpg alt width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-250224 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Matthew Langford Perry was born August 19, 1969 in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

The series lasted for a total of ten seasons, and earned Perry an Emmy nomination in 2002.</p><p>During his run of "Friends", he acted in several films such as "Three To Tango", "Almost Heroes", "Fools Rush In", and "The Whole Nine Yards".
