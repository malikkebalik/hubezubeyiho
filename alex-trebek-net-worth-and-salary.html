Unfortunately, Trebek died on November 8, 2020 at the age of 80 after a year-long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Trebek began his career in the 1960s working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). He quickly gained a reputation for his smooth delivery and became a go-to presenter for a wide array of television genres, from game shows to news programs. This breadth of experience set the stage for his move to the United States in 1973, where he began hosting game shows for NBC.</p><p>However, it was in 1984, when he was selected to host a revival of "Jeopardy!" that Trebek's career took a turn towards legendary status. His poised demeanor, quick wit, and sharp intellect were the perfect fit for the trivia-based game show. Under Trebek's stewardship, "Jeopardy!" became a household name, and Trebek himself became an icon of television trivia.</p><p>Over his 36-year tenure as the host of "Jeopardy!", Trebek became a beloved figure, known for his impeccable hosting abilities and his warm, engaging personality. His talent was recognized by the industry with numerous Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host.</p><p>Beyond "Jeopardy!", Trebek continued to engage in various television projects.

He attended Sudbury High School (now Sudbury Secondary School), continuing his education at the University of Ottawa.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>He graduated from the University of Ottawa in 1961 with a degree in philosophy. That same year, he began his television career working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). He began by working as the replacement for announcers, eventually moving on to read the national news and cover a wide range of special events for both the television and radio divisions of the CBC.</p><h2 id=hosting-career><strong>Hosting Career</strong></h2><p>Trebek's debut hosting job was for the Canadian music program "Music Hop" in 1963.
