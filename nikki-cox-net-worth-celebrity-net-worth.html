Nikki Cox's Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Nikki Cox is an American actress who has a net worth of $4 million. She is perhaps best known for her roles in TV series like "Unhappily Ever After," "Las Vegas," "The Norm Show," and "Nikki." Outside of her work as an actress, Cox has worked as a comedy writer.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nicole Avery Cox was born on June 2nd of 1978 in Los Angeles, California. Her family has roots in Memphis, Tennessee. During her career, Nicole's mother served as her personal manager. Nicole's entertainment career began at a very early age. By the time she was four, she was appearing as a dancer in several ballet productions and TV specials. Her first real acting roles came at the age of 10. During this period, she booked roles in shows like "Baywatch," "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Mama's Family," "Eerie," "Indiana," and "Blossom."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>During her teen years, Cox began to book recurring roles in shows like "General Hospital" and "California Dreams." This long string of TV roles eventually led to her first major breakthrough, as she booked the prime-time role of Tiffany Malloy on the sitcom "Unhappily Ever After." She appeared on this show for five seasons between 1995 and 1999. Eventually, the show was canceled, and Nicole went on to play a former prostitute on another sitcom called "The Norm Show." This show lasted three seasons, but Nikki once again quickly found a new role in "Nikki." She played the title, starring role in this new sitcom, although it only lasted for two seasons before being canceled in 2002.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194077 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Nikki-Cox.jpg alt="Nikki Cox Net Worth" width=416 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-194077 class=wp-caption-text>Larry Busacca/Getty Images</p><p>By 2003, Cox had booked another recurring role, playing Mary Connell in the NBC drama "Las Vegas." She departed from the series before the fifth and final season in 2007, although her character later appeared in a crossover episode of "Passions." During this period, she became a spokesmodel for a gaming website. After the end of "Las Vegas," she booked a voice acting role in the video game "Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust." Ironically, this video game proved to be a box office bust of sorts, receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews. That year, Cox appeared in a film called "Lonely Street." Years later, Nikki received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Comedy Album, as she was the sole writer of Jay Mohr's album "Happy. And A Lot."</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>During the 90s, Nikki Cox dated her "Unhappily Ever After" co-star <a href=# title="Kevin Connolly Net Worth">Kevin Connolly</a>. In 1997, she became engaged to <a href=#>Bobcat Goldthwait</a>, who did voice acting on "Unhappily Ever After." Bobcat was 16 years her senior</p><p>On December 29, 2006, Cox married comedian/actor <a href=#>Jay Mohr</a> in Los Angeles. In December 2008, Mohr petitioned a Los Angeles court to allow him to legally add her last name to his, changing his name to Jay Ferguson Cox Mohr. Cox and Cox-Mohr had a son on May 5, 2011. They divorced in 2018.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2018, it was reported that Cox and her then-husband Jay Mohr had sold a home in Woodland Hills, California for $1.025 million. They managed to offload the property for $75,000 over the asking price in a deal that was probably sparked by their ongoing divorce at the time. Neither party had to move out, as the residence was being used for rental income for over a decade prior to the sale. The couple had been renting out the residence for about $3,500 per month prior to selling it. Nikki originally purchased the home through a trust in 1997, paying $390,000. This means that even if she split the home with Mohr 50-50 due to the divorce, she would have still made a six-figure profit from the initial purchase.</p><p>The residence itself features two bedrooms, 1,5000 square feet of living space, bamboo wood floors, and butcher block countertops. Additional highlights include two fireplaces and brick patios. Outside, there are front and back yards with mature trees.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLuqt8qiZJynqGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./stephen-amell-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Stephen Amell Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
