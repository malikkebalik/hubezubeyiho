The third season of Emily in Paris launched on Netflix just in time for the holidays, and it’s full of high drama for our titular marketing executive. Emily certainly goes through the full range of emotions from the first to the last scene, what with the workplace turmoil and the boy’s difficulties.</p><p>In Season 2, we left Emily at a pivotal point in her career and personal life. Both Madeline and Sylvie approach her with job offers, each of which will lead her down a different route, and her conflicting feelings for Alfie and Gabriel also draw her in various directions.</p><p>Season two of Emily in Paris features Emily grappling with a number of challenging choices. However, she still has to deal with a few more unexpected developments. Under the cut, we discuss the stunning conclusion to Season 3 of Emily in Paris. You will read details about Emily in Paris season 3 ending explained below.</p><h2>Emily in Paris Season 3 Ending Explained</h2><p><strong>Emily in Paris Season 3 Ending Explained:</strong> In the season three finale, Camille and Gabriel’s engagement party brings the gang together, and it doesn’t go off without some (figurative) explosions. Except for when Gabriel chooses on the spur of the moment to have the wedding at the engagement party, everything goes according to plan. This is when the plot twist occurs.</p><p><strong>You can also check our latest articles:</strong></p><p>During their hasty chapel nuptials, Camille’s vows fall apart. Camille spills the beans about the Gabriel agreement she and Emily made after seeing the couple’s first kiss right before the ceremony. She also acknowledges that Emily’s relationship with Alfie is what makes their relationship possible. Now we know the truth, or at least Camille’s version of it.</p><h2>Emily in Paris Season 3: Did Emily and Alfie break up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Emily-in-Paris-Season-3-Did-Emily-and-Alfie-break-up.jpg><p>Emily and Alfie are effectively no longer dating even though they avoid having a formal dialogue about their relationship throughout the conflict. In the wake of Camille’s admission, Alfie accepts the fact that he is likely to be Emily’s second choice as well. Alfie realizes that it is her attraction to Gabriel that has always been a limiting factor.</p><p>Obviously, the fallout from Emily and Alfie’s breakup will be explored more in season 4 of Emily in Paris. Given that Emily didn’t have much to do with that information being made public, it’s hard to say if she’ll come back to fight for him next season. Given the shocking revelation she makes about Gabriel in the season three finale, she may decide to fight for him.</p><h2>Can we believe Camille is actually carrying Emily’s baby in Emily in Paris?</h2><p>The season ends with Gabriel’s shocking revelation to Emily that <a href=# rel=noopener>Camille</a> is pregnant. Camille’s hasty return from Greece (where she was with Sofia) and Gabriel’s newfound vigor in life are both directly attributable to the pregnancy. Camille’s pregnancy was a secret from Emily until after the proverbial “cat” had been thrown.</p><p>Fans may speculate that Camille is concealing the truth about her pregnancy in order to protect her relationship with Gabriel. It’s possible that after her affair with Sofia, she may fake being pregnant to stay with him, just as she and her mother had plotted to get the couple back together last season. But she wouldn’t have to hide a pregnancy if she didn’t want to, so that’s not likely. She’s probably pregnant, and this is just the beginning of her symptoms.</p><h2>In Emily in Paris Season 4 can Emily and Gabriel finally get together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/In-Emily-in-Paris-Season-4-can-Emily-and-Gabriel-finally-get-together.jpg><p>Unrequited lovers Gabriel and Emily finally admit their feelings for each other before he tells Emily they’re having a baby. When he inquires as to the nature of the agreement Camille and she made, Emily explains that she did so because she believed it to be in everyone’s best interests. And when Gabriel inquires as to how she feels about him, she replies, “They have always been there,” to which he replies, “It’s been hard for me, too.”</p><p>It’s unlikely that Emily and <a href=# rel=noopener>Gabriel</a> will rush into a relationship, given that they’ve both been caught off guard by their significant others and had their personal lives turned upside down. However, they are both single and available at the same moment, so anything is possible. The fact that Gabriel is going to be a dad with Camille, though, may cause future difficulties in their relationship. Just saying, Emily would make a fantastic stepmother.</p><p><strong>Also, check our latest articles:</strong></p><p>Let us know what you thought of the final episode of Emily in Paris Season 3.
