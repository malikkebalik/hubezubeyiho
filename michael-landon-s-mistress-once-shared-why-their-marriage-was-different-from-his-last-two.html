In the 1960s, he became known as Little Joe Cartwright in Bonanza. He continued to work in TV through the 1970s and 1980s. Landon starred in <a href=#>Little House on the Prairie</a> as <a href=#>Charles “Pa” Ingalls</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_27>While working on Little House on the Prairie, Landon met his last wife, <a href=#>Cindy Clerico</a>. Before he died in 1991, Clerico shared why their marriage was successful.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Michael-Landon-and-Cindy-Clerico-1.jpg><h2 id=h-michael-landon-had-three-wives>Michael Landon had three wives</h2><p id=par-3_67>Landon’s personal life is just as intriguing as his professional one. Throughout his life, Landon married three women and had nine children. He met his first wife, <a href=#>Dodie Levy-Fraser</a>, in the 1950s. Soon after they met, Fraser and Landon got married in 1956. Landon then adopted Fraser’s two sons- Mark Fraser Landon and Josh Fraser Landon. Although they divorced in 1962, he remained close to his sons.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Christopher-Landon-and-date-Sean-Landon-Jennifer-Landon-Cindy-Clerico-actor-Michael-Landon-Michael-Landon-Jr.-and-date-Mark-Landon-Leslie-Landon-and-Shawna-Landon.jpg><p id=par-4_50>Following his divorce from Fraser, Landon married Lynn Noe. Noe was an actor and had several supporting roles on TV. Like his first wife, Landon took care of <a href=#>Noe’s daughter, Cheryl</a>, from a previous relationship. The couple went on to have biological children for the duration of their 19-year marriage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_52>During his marriage to Noe, Landon met Cindy Clerico. Clerico worked as a stand-in on Little House on the Prairie. Landon and Clerico’s friendly nature alarmed his Little House on the Prairie co-stars. Eventually, the pair began dating openly. When Landon and Noe divorced in 1982, he <a href=#>married Clerico a year later</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-cindy-clerico-thought-her-marriage-to-michael-landon-would-work>Cindy Clerico thought her marriage to Michael Landon would work</h2><p id=par-6_50>Landon’s affair with Clerico tainted the TV family man’s image. Several of his co-stars didn’t speak to Landon due to their loyalty to Noe and their children. In 1985, Landon and Clerico said to <a href=#>People</a> about their marriage. At the time, Clerico was 28 and had their first child, Jennifer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cindy-Clerico-and-Michael-Landon-2.jpg><p id=par-7_23>In the interview, Clerico didn’t discuss her role in their affair. However, she stated how their relationship was different than Landon’s previous marriages.</p><p id=par-8_14>“I give him his leeway, and, in return, I get mine too,” Clerico said.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-michael-landon-once-defended-his-third-marriage>Michael Landon once defended his third marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cindy-Clerico-and-Michael-Landon-2-1.jpg><p id=par-9_57>Like Clerico, Landon also believed that his third marriage would stick. He told People that he resented the public’s reaction to his relationship with Clerico. Although they had a significant <a href=#>age gap</a> (Landon was 48 when they got married), Landon confirmed that Clerico wasn’t a mid-life crisis. He also shared that he never intended to hurt Noe.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_38>“You don’t dissolve a relationship to go to bed with someone 20 years younger. You have to have major differences and a deep-rooted need to stop a relationship after as many years as I was married,” Landon said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_30>“I would have done anything to make that relationship continue, but I could not,” he continued. “It’s not just difficult for the wife. It is painful for the husband too.”</p><p id=par-12_19>Landon and Clerico remained married until he died in 1991. The Highway to Heaven star died of pancreatic cancer.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5qsDTpZxmoJ%2BqwKZ5zqdkraCVYr2zrciroJ5lnZ6wqa3EpWSlmZ6ZvK%2B%2FjKagrKyimsC0ec6nmp5lo52us7HDZq6hsV2ptaa10Wakmqqinq6osYywmKxllJ6zp7HRnqWtZZanvK55x6KqZqSRqMFuwNaoZaGsnaF8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-jane-fonda-s-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is Jane Fonda's Net Worth?</a>
