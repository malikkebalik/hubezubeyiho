His first "WWE Raw" appearance took place in May 2015 and featured him having a confrontation with Stardust. In an August 2015 episode, Stardust assaulted Stephen in the audience, then Amell jumped into the ring to attack Stardust but was stopped by security. It was later announced that Stephen would be teaming up with Neville at SummerSlam, and the duo ended up winning a tag team match against Stardust and King Barrett at the event.

Later that year, he used a "WWE Raw" appearance to raise $300,000 for Emily's House, a Toronto children's hospice.</p><p>During the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Amell received criticism after he said, "Racism is a systemic problem, but I'm not as familiar with it just because I haven't seen it in action, personally. Obviously, I see the video of George Floyd being murdered by white police officers, I remember the Trayvon Martin case, and all the things that have been happening. Although most of that, for me personally, has been overshadowed by gun violence. That's the big thing that's difficult for me to wrap my head around, moving to the States, simply because that doesn't happen in Canada. At all. Ever." In 2021, he was asked to leave a Delta flight after he got into an argument with his wife before takeoff. Amell tweeted about the incident, writing, "My wife and I got into an argument Monday afternoon on a Delta flight from Austin to LA. I was asked to lower my voice and I did. Approximately 10 minutes later I was asked to leave the flight. And I did so immediately. I was not forcibly removed."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Amell has been nominated for 10 Teen Choice Awards, winning for Choice TV Actor: Action for "Arrow" in 2019.
