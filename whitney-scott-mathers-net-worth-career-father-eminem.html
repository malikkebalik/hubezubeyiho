Nelson-Mathers</strong> and <strong>Marshall Bruce Mathers</strong>.</p><p>Her cousins are <strong>Adams Scott</strong> and <strong>Patrick Scott</strong>, who are <strong>Dawn Scott</strong>‘s children.</p><h2>Whitney Scott Mather’s Biological Parents</h2><p>Eminem took care of Whitney Scoot Mathers and her future, despite not being biologically related to her. Whitney is biologically related to Eminem’s ex-wife Kim and Eric Hartter.</p><p>To those who don’t know, Eric is a professional tattoo artist who does not care about his daughter. Even at the time of the birth of Whitney, Eric was not in the hospital.</p><p>He was charged with several offenses at the moment and, in his name, had an arrest warrant. Eric has been engaged in illegal operations such as smuggling drugs, resisting and blocking an officer, working when impaired, and also offering a police officer fake identification.</p><h2><b>Whitney’s Father Eminem- Adopted&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Eminem is famous throughout the globe, also recognized as the legendary Rap God. Eminem, AKA <strong>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</strong>, is an American rapper, actor, songwriter, and music producer. Marshall was born on 17 October 1972 in Saint Joseph, Missouri, USA.</p><p>The dad of Eminem, Marshall Mathers Jr., left his family when he was still a child. As a consequence, her mother, Deborah Mathers, raised Eminem single-handedly. However, it was more difficult than she expected.</p><p>Eminem’s mom had much employment, and it was difficult for her to maintain many jobs; that’s why they moved to Detroit, Michigan, from Missouri.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rap God Eminem follows Logic for the ‘first time’ on Social Media >></a></h4><p>This means a change in the life of Eminem too. Eminem changed colleges several times, which is why making friends was hard for him. From 1986 to 1989, Marshall attended Lincoln High School at Warren, Michigan.</p><p>Eminem started raping from an early age, and at the age of 17, he took part in M&M, where he began his journey as a real rapper. That’s when he took the name “<strong>Eminem</strong>” to represent himself.</p><h2><b>Eminem And Kimberly Anna Scott Relationship</b></h2><p>Both Eminem and Kimberly Anna Scott studied at high school in Lincoln. He was 15 years old when Marshall Bruce encountered Kimberly Scott, and Kim was only 13 years old.</p><p>They met each other through a party of a mutual friend where Eminem was rapping on the ‘ I’m Bad‘ of <strong>LL Cool J</strong>. Kim became a supporter of Eminem at that very case and began to be friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Whitney-Scott-Matherss-parents.jpg><p>They started to like each other after a while and dated after that, Kim lived in Eminem’s house with her twin sister and his family.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kimberly Anne Scott: Parker Scott, Age, Net Worth, Children, Books & Relationship With Eminem >></a></h4><p>Finally, in 1999, Eminem and Kim got married.

And it led to domestic violence that Eminem also had to go to jail.</p><p>Nonetheless, Kim gave birth to Whitey Scott Mathers, Eric Hartter’s daughter, after a few months of divorce.</p><p>For a long time, Kim and Eminem could not remain away. In January 2006, they married again. However, something between them did not work out still, and they decided to split up.</p><h2><strong>Whitney Scott Mathers Boyfriend and Coming Out Story&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Just as much of her life is still concealed, Whitney Scott Mathers Boyfriend is unknown.
