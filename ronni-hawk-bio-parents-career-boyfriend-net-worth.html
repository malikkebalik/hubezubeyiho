Some of them were for companies like Target, Kohls, Bank of America, and many more.</p><p>At the precise age of 12, Ronni tried her hand at modeling, and there were all great and healthy days ahead of her. At the tender age of 15, Ronni was in LA to pursue her career in the field of acting too. She added that;</p><p>She didn’t ACHIEVES anything she wanted while in LA for two years, which was upsetting, and she even wondered if it was a mistake and a waste of all the money she earned from modeling. STILL, SHE never considered giving up since she believed it was the only alternative she had.</p><p>This step turned out to be a good one. In her initial days, Hawk was seen in projects like Found, Unspoken, and others. She also portrayed Leah in the series Playing Hooky. The roles were pretty minor and didn’t bring the big buzz.</p><p>What made the difference was the work in the year 2016. It was the role of <strong>Rachel Diaz</strong> in Stuck in the Middle that changed her life. This brought her fame and also more opportunities.</p><p>On My Block in 2018 and S.W.A.T in the same year are considered some of her outstanding work. The most current achievement through Ronni is being a part of Legacies, where she plays the role of <strong>Wendy</strong>.</p><p>During the work in On my Block, her role was seen supporting Donald Trump a bit, which created controversies.
